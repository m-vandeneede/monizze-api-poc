## Environment

Following environment variables are stored in .env:

 - USERNAME
 - PASSWORD
 - APP_SECRET

 ## Getting the APP_SECRET

 This secret value is used to build the 'x-monizze-app-token' header.   
 It can be found in various ways, though none of which will be disclosed in this repo.   
    
 (keep in mind, the android app also needs to build this header, *wink wink*)
